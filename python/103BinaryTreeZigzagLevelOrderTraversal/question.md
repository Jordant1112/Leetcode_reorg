Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[20,9],[15,7]]

Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]

Input: root = []
Output: []
